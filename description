Multi-view a technique in which multiple views (features) are considers for any classification problem.
Here I am going to apply the same for seizure detection on EEG data.
A CHB-MIT dataset is used for this project.
Obtain Time-domain views and feature domain views to achieve a Multi-view approach.
A CNN model is used to detect the seizure.
